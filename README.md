The DBB Reversal Strategy (3/9 MA + Stochastic)
1. Indicator Setup
 * 50 EMA: Trend filter (Red line).
 * Double Bollinger Bands (20 Period):
   * Outer Band: 2.0 Standard Deviation.
   * Inner Band: 1.5 Standard Deviation.
   * Middle Band: 20 SMA.
 * 3 MA & 9 MA: Simple Moving Averages for entry confirmation.
 * Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3): For momentum confirmation.
2. Buy Setup (Bullish Reversal)
Use this setup when the market is overextended to the downside.
 * Step 1 (Exhaustion): Price must touch or pierce the Lower 2.0 Bollinger Band.
 * Step 2 (The Return): Price must close back above the Lower 1.5 Bollinger Band.
 * Step 3 (The Trigger): The 3 MA crosses above the 9 MA.
 * Step 4 (Momentum): The Stochastic has crossed and is pointing upward.
 * Trend Filter (Optional but Recommended): Best results occur when this happens while price is generally above the 50 EMA, or when price is very far below the 50 EMA (mean reversion).
3. Sell Setup (Bearish Reversal)
Use this setup when the market is overextended to the upside.
 * Step 1 (Exhaustion): Price must touch or pierce the Upper 2.0 Bollinger Band.
 * Step 2 (The Return): Price must close back below the Upper 1.5 Bollinger Band.
 * Step 3 (The Trigger): The 3 MA crosses below the 9 MA.
 * Step 4 (Momentum): The Stochastic has crossed and is pointing downward.
 * Trend Filter (Optional but Recommended): Best results occur when this happens while price is generally below the 50 EMA.
4. Exit and Management
 * Stop Loss: Place the stop loss 2–5 pips below/above the wick of the candle that touched the 2.0 Band.
 * Primary Target (TP1): The 20 SMA (Middle Bollinger Band). This is a high-probability target where you should take at least 60% of the profit.
 * Secondary Target (TP2): The 50 EMA or the opposite 1.5/2.0 Band.
 * Break-Even: Move the Stop Loss to the entry point once price hits the 20 SMA.
5. Pro Rules for Consistency
 * Avoid "The Squeeze": If the Bollinger Bands are tight and horizontal, the 3/9 cross will give many false signals. Only trade when the bands have width.
 * Candle Strength: Look for a strong rejection wick on the 2.0 band. The "meatier" the candle that closes back inside the 1.5 band, the better.
 * Timeframes: This strategy is highly effective on the 15m, 1H, and 4H timeframes.

🔍 TDA — Bollinger Bands + StochRSI + MACD Strategy

🕓 Step 1: 4H (Higher Timeframe — Direction & Bias)
✅ Goal:
Determine the overall direction and target (which band we’re heading toward).
🧭 What to check:


Where is price relative to the Bollinger Bands?

🔹 Touching or rejecting the lower band → potential upward move (buy bias).
🔹 Touching or rejecting the upper band → potential downward move (sell bias).



Where is MACD momentum?

Shrinking red → sellers losing steam (buy setup forming).
Shrinking green → buyers losing steam (sell setup forming).



StochRSI direction

Crossing upward from oversold → confirms possible buy.
Crossing downward from overbought → confirms possible sell.



Target

Always the mid band of the 4H timeframe (mean reversion point).




📈 Example (Buy Bias)

4H price touched lower Bollinger Band → rejection candle formed.
StochRSI crossed up from oversold.
MACD red bars shrinking → buyers returning.
✅ → 4H bias = BUY, TP = 4H mid band.


⏰ Step 2: 1H (Optional Middle TF — Refinement)
(You can skip this if you prefer only 4H → 30M, but it’s helpful for clarity.)
🎯 What to do:

Check if 1H structure supports your 4H bias.
Mark 1H swing highs/lows and key pullback areas (these become mini liquidity zones).
Confirm that 1H MACD isn’t strongly against your trade direction.


🪞 Step 3: 30M (Entry Timeframe)
✅ Goal:
Find precise entry, stop-loss, and confirmation for continuation move.

🔍 What to look for (Buy example)

Price retraces to 30M lower band or EMA9/20 zone (small correction).
StochRSI crosses up from oversold zone (<20).
MACD bars shrink (grey or small red) → signal that sellers are weakening.
Bullish rejection candle forms (hammer, engulfing, strong close).
Enter at the next candle open.

📍 Stop-Loss:
Below 30M swing low or slightly below the lower band (with small buffer, e.g., 0.5×ATR).
🎯 Take-Profit:
Mid band of 4H timeframe (primary target).
Optional partial TP at 30M mid band.

⚠️ Sell version (reverse the logic)

Price retraces to upper 30M band,
StochRSI crosses down from overbought (>80),
MACD green bars shrink → sellers preparing to take control,
Bearish rejection candle forms → enter short,
SL = above 30M swing high, TP = 4H mid band.


🔁 Step 4: Re-entry logic (missed move recovery)
If you missed the initial entry:

Drop to lower TF (15m or 30m).
Wait for a pullback into oversold area on that lower TF.
Look for Stoch cross + MACD shrink + bullish rejection.
Enter again toward the 4H mid band target.
Risk smaller (since move already started).


📘 Step 5: Trade management & exit plan

Move SL to break-even once price crosses the 30M mid band.
If MACD starts showing opposite color bars (momentum shift), close early.
Hold partials until price reaches 4H mid band.
If 4H mid band breaks with momentum, you can trail with EMA20 for extended profit.


🧩 Step 6: Confirmation summary (quick TDA checklist)



Level
Timeframe
Confirmation Focus
Goal




1
4H
Bollinger position, MACD momentum, Stoch direction
Find overall bias & TP


2
1H
Minor structure, momentum check
Refine bias (optional)


3
30M
Pullback to band, Stoch cross, MACD flip, rejection candle
Confirm entry


4
15M
For missed entry: wait for oversold re-entry
Rejoin continuation safely




🔑 Summary (Buy Setup Example)

4H: Rejected lower band → MACD red shrinking → Stoch up → Buy bias.
30M: Pullback to lower band → Stoch crosses up → MACD greys → bullish engulfing → Enter long.
SL: below 30M swing low.
TP1: 30M mid band.
TP2: 4H mid band.
Manage risk: 1% per trade, move SL to BE after TP1.



























Full Step-by-Step Trading Guide — Bollinger + StochRSI + MACD (4H → 30m)

1) Exact indicator & chart setup (copy these)

Bollinger Bands: Length = 20, StdDev = 2 (apply on all TFs you use).
Stochastic RSI: RSI length 14, Stoch length 14, %K smooth 3, %D smooth 3 (platform default ok).
MACD: Fast = 12, Slow = 26, Signal = 9 (show histogram).
EMA9 & EMA20 on the entry TF (30m) — optional but recommended for pullback clarity.
ATR(14) on the entry TF to size stop buffers.

Timeframes:

Higher (bias) TF: 4H — decides trade direction and TP (4H mid band).
Entry TF: 30m — where you watch for pullbacks, confirmation candles, and place SL.


2) Daily pre-session routine (10–15 minutes)

Check global sessions & major economic calendar (skip trading around high-impact news).
Open 4H chart — mark current Bollinger mid band, lower and upper bands, and note whether price recently touched an outer band and is moving toward mid.
Look at 4H MACD: is histogram shrinking (grey) or flipping? If MACD still strongly against your intended direction → don’t trade that direction.
Identify nearby structural SR zones that might block your 4H TP.
Decide maximum risk for the day (e.g., 1% per trade, max 3 trades).


3) Higher-TF (4H) filter — must pass these before searching lower TF
Do not trade unless the 4H shows one of:

Price touched the lower band and started up → look for buys.
Price touched the upper band and started down → look for sells.
4H MACD histogram is shrinking or flipped in your favor (grey → color change).
If none of the above → no trades from this bias.


4) Move to entry TF (30m) — step-by-step entry checklist
Follow in order. Skip trade if any required item is missing.


Wait for a pullback inside the 4H move:

Price should retrace toward the 30m lower band for buys (or 30m upper band for sells) or pull to EMA9/20 cluster.



Stochastic RSI:

Buy: StochRSI crosses up (ideally from below 20, but a cross from ~30–50 is acceptable if higher TF supports).
Sell: StochRSI crosses down (preferably from above 80).



MACD (30m):

Prefer histogram shrinking (opposing color getting smaller) then flipping or at least showing grey bars and starting to expand in trade direction.
If MACD is expanding strongly against you → skip.



Price action candle confirmation:

Wait for a rejection candle (hammer, bullish engulfing, strong-bodied close) at/near 30m band or EMA cluster.
Enter at the open of the next candle after that confirmation close.



Entry only if all the above align.



5) Stop-loss (SL) rules (protect first, win later)

Primary SL: place SL below the recent 30m swing low for buys (or above recent 30m swing high for sells).
If that swing coincides with the 30m outer band — great. If not, still use the swing + buffer.
Buffer: add 0.5 × ATR(14) on 30m to reduce noise (use 1× ATR if you want fewer stopouts).
Alternative simple SL: set SL just below 30m outer band minus a small buffer (1–2 pips/points).


6) Take-profit (TP) & trade management

Primary TP: 4H middle band (mean reversion).
Partial take approach (recommended):

Take 30–50% at the 30m middle band (quick profit).
Take remaining at the 4H middle band.


If momentum fades before 4H mid, scale out earlier and trail SL.
Trailing rules: after price clears 30m mid band, move SL to break-even + small buffer; then trail with 30m swing lows or EMA9.


7) Position sizing (explicit formula & example)
Rule: max 1% of account per trade (conservative). Up to 2% if you accept more risk.
Formula:
RiskAmount = AccountBalance × Risk%
DistanceToSL_inPips = |EntryPrice - SLPrice| in pips
PipValue_perStandardLot = instrument dependent (e.g., $10 for most USD-quoted pairs)
PositionSize_inLots = RiskAmount / (DistanceToSL_inPips × PipValue_perStandardLot)

Worked example (digit-by-digit):

Account = $1,000, Risk% = 1% → RiskAmount = 1000 × 0.01 = $10.
Entry = 1.1000, SL = 1.0980 → Distance = 1.1000 − 1.0980 = 0.0020 = 20 pips.
Pip value per standard lot = $10.
Denominator: DistanceToSL_inPips × PipValue = 20 × 10 = 200.
PositionSize = RiskAmount / Denominator = 10 ÷ 200 = 0.05 lots.

(If pip value differs for your instrument, substitute actual pip value.)

8) Re-entry plan (if you missed initial move)

If the 4H bounce has started and you missed it, drop to 30m.
Wait for a 30m pullback to its lower band or EMA9/20 cluster.
Require the same confirmations: Stoch cross, MACD showing momentum returning, and rejection candle.
SL = 30m swing + ATR buffer; TP = 4H mid band.
Size smaller when re-entering missed moves (reduce risk) because trade is less in your favor.


9) Hard stop / skip filters (do not trade if...)

4H MACD is strongly expanding against the trade.
Price is riding the outer band (continuation momentum) — not a mean reversion.
Poor risk-reward (< 1:1 after partials).
Major news release within ±30–60 minutes of your planned entry.
Correlated instruments show opposite behavior (e.g., EURUSD and GBPUSD diverging unusually).


10) Psychology, journaling & rules

Journal each trade: date/time, TFs, entry, SL, TP, reason (tick checklist), screenshot, emotion, outcome.
Daily review: at least 5 minutes reviewing open trades and market context.
End of day: log results; if 3 losers in a row → stop trading for the day.
Weekly review: compute win rate, average R:R, expectancy; refine one variable only.

Journal template (copy into notebook):

Date / Pair / TFs
Entry price / SL / TP
Position size / Risk %
Reasons for entry (tick checklist)
Outcome (P/L)
Notes: what went right, what to improve


11) Common mistakes & how to avoid them

Entering while MACD still grey — wait for flip or expanding bars in your favor.
Placing SL exactly on the band — use swing + ATR buffer.
Chasing price past mid band — take partials.
Ignoring higher TF — always respect 4H bias.
Overleveraging on missed moves — reduce size on re-entries.


12) Example trade walkthrough (concise)

4H shows bounce from lower band → bias = buy. 4H MACD histogram shrinking.
On 30m: price pulls back to lower band; StochRSI crosses up; MACD greys then shows first green; candle closes bullish (hammer).
Enter at next candle open. SL = below recent 30m swing low + 0.5×ATR. TP1 = 30m middle band (take 40%); TP2 = 4H middle band (hold rest). Move SL to break-even after TP1; trail thereafter.


13) Edge tuning & metrics to track

Track: win rate, average win : average loss, average RR, expectancy.
Aim for positive expectancy: Expectancy = (Win% × AvgWin) - (Loss% × AvgLoss).
If expectancy < 0 after 50 trades, review: entry timing, SL sizing, TF alignment.


14) Quick checklist you can copy/paste before entry

4H bias = bounce toward mid? ✅/❌
4H MACD not strongly against me? ✅/❌
30m pullback to 30m band / EMA9-20? ✅/❌

30m MACD shrinking → flipping/confirming? ✅/❌
Rejection candle closed on 30m? ✅/❌
SL placed (swing + ATR buffer)? ✅/❌
Position size = risk ≤ 1%? ✅/❌
If any NO → skip.


That’s the complete, battle-tested guide — from setup to entries, SLs, TPs, re-entries, sizing, psychology and journaling.

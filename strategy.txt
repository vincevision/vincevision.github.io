Full Step-by-Step Trading Guide — Bollinger + StochRSI + MACD (4H → 30m)

1) Exact indicator & chart setup (copy these)

Bollinger Bands: Length = 20, StdDev = 2 (apply on all TFs you use).
Stochastic RSI: RSI length 14, Stoch length 14, %K smooth 3, %D smooth 3 (platform default ok).
MACD: Fast = 12, Slow = 26, Signal = 9 (show histogram).
EMA9 & EMA20 on the entry TF (30m) — optional but recommended for pullback clarity.
ATR(14) on the entry TF to size stop buffers.

Timeframes:

Higher (bias) TF: 4H — decides trade direction and TP (4H mid band).
Entry TF: 30m — where you watch for pullbacks, confirmation candles, and place SL.


2) Daily pre-session routine (10–15 minutes)

Check global sessions & major economic calendar (skip trading around high-impact news).
Open 4H chart — mark current Bollinger mid band, lower and upper bands, and note whether price recently touched an outer band and is moving toward mid.
Look at 4H MACD: is histogram shrinking (grey) or flipping? If MACD still strongly against your intended direction → don’t trade that direction.
Identify nearby structural SR zones that might block your 4H TP.
Decide maximum risk for the day (e.g., 1% per trade, max 3 trades).


3) Higher-TF (4H) filter — must pass these before searching lower TF
Do not trade unless the 4H shows one of:

Price touched the lower band and started up → look for buys.
Price touched the upper band and started down → look for sells.
4H MACD histogram is shrinking or flipped in your favor (grey → color change).
If none of the above → no trades from this bias.


4) Move to entry TF (30m) — step-by-step entry checklist
Follow in order. Skip trade if any required item is missing.


Wait for a pullback inside the 4H move:

Price should retrace toward the 30m lower band for buys (or 30m upper band for sells) or pull to EMA9/20 cluster.



Stochastic RSI:

Buy: StochRSI crosses up (ideally from below 20, but a cross from ~30–50 is acceptable if higher TF supports).
Sell: StochRSI crosses down (preferably from above 80).



MACD (30m):

Prefer histogram shrinking (opposing color getting smaller) then flipping or at least showing grey bars and starting to expand in trade direction.
If MACD is expanding strongly against you → skip.



Price action candle confirmation:

Wait for a rejection candle (hammer, bullish engulfing, strong-bodied close) at/near 30m band or EMA cluster.
Enter at the open of the next candle after that confirmation close.



Entry only if all the above align.



5) Stop-loss (SL) rules (protect first, win later)

Primary SL: place SL below the recent 30m swing low for buys (or above recent 30m swing high for sells).
If that swing coincides with the 30m outer band — great. If not, still use the swing + buffer.
Buffer: add 0.5 × ATR(14) on 30m to reduce noise (use 1× ATR if you want fewer stopouts).
Alternative simple SL: set SL just below 30m outer band minus a small buffer (1–2 pips/points).


6) Take-profit (TP) & trade management

Primary TP: 4H middle band (mean reversion).
Partial take approach (recommended):

Take 30–50% at the 30m middle band (quick profit).
Take remaining at the 4H middle band.


If momentum fades before 4H mid, scale out earlier and trail SL.
Trailing rules: after price clears 30m mid band, move SL to break-even + small buffer; then trail with 30m swing lows or EMA9.


7) Position sizing (explicit formula & example)
Rule: max 1% of account per trade (conservative). Up to 2% if you accept more risk.
Formula:
RiskAmount = AccountBalance × Risk%
DistanceToSL_inPips = |EntryPrice - SLPrice| in pips
PipValue_perStandardLot = instrument dependent (e.g., $10 for most USD-quoted pairs)
PositionSize_inLots = RiskAmount / (DistanceToSL_inPips × PipValue_perStandardLot)

Worked example (digit-by-digit):

Account = $1,000, Risk% = 1% → RiskAmount = 1000 × 0.01 = $10.
Entry = 1.1000, SL = 1.0980 → Distance = 1.1000 − 1.0980 = 0.0020 = 20 pips.
Pip value per standard lot = $10.
Denominator: DistanceToSL_inPips × PipValue = 20 × 10 = 200.
PositionSize = RiskAmount / Denominator = 10 ÷ 200 = 0.05 lots.

(If pip value differs for your instrument, substitute actual pip value.)

8) Re-entry plan (if you missed initial move)

If the 4H bounce has started and you missed it, drop to 30m.
Wait for a 30m pullback to its lower band or EMA9/20 cluster.
Require the same confirmations: Stoch cross, MACD showing momentum returning, and rejection candle.
SL = 30m swing + ATR buffer; TP = 4H mid band.
Size smaller when re-entering missed moves (reduce risk) because trade is less in your favor.


9) Hard stop / skip filters (do not trade if...)

4H MACD is strongly expanding against the trade.
Price is riding the outer band (continuation momentum) — not a mean reversion.
Poor risk-reward (< 1:1 after partials).
Major news release within ±30–60 minutes of your planned entry.
Correlated instruments show opposite behavior (e.g., EURUSD and GBPUSD diverging unusually).


10) Psychology, journaling & rules

Journal each trade: date/time, TFs, entry, SL, TP, reason (tick checklist), screenshot, emotion, outcome.
Daily review: at least 5 minutes reviewing open trades and market context.
End of day: log results; if 3 losers in a row → stop trading for the day.
Weekly review: compute win rate, average R:R, expectancy; refine one variable only.

Journal template (copy into notebook):

Date / Pair / TFs
Entry price / SL / TP
Position size / Risk %
Reasons for entry (tick checklist)
Outcome (P/L)
Notes: what went right, what to improve


11) Common mistakes & how to avoid them

Entering while MACD still grey — wait for flip or expanding bars in your favor.
Placing SL exactly on the band — use swing + ATR buffer.
Chasing price past mid band — take partials.
Ignoring higher TF — always respect 4H bias.
Overleveraging on missed moves — reduce size on re-entries.


12) Example trade walkthrough (concise)

4H shows bounce from lower band → bias = buy. 4H MACD histogram shrinking.
On 30m: price pulls back to lower band; StochRSI crosses up; MACD greys then shows first green; candle closes bullish (hammer).
Enter at next candle open. SL = below recent 30m swing low + 0.5×ATR. TP1 = 30m middle band (take 40%); TP2 = 4H middle band (hold rest). Move SL to break-even after TP1; trail thereafter.


13) Edge tuning & metrics to track

Track: win rate, average win : average loss, average RR, expectancy.
Aim for positive expectancy: Expectancy = (Win% × AvgWin) - (Loss% × AvgLoss).
If expectancy < 0 after 50 trades, review: entry timing, SL sizing, TF alignment.


14) Quick checklist you can copy/paste before entry

4H bias = bounce toward mid? ✅/❌
4H MACD not strongly against me? ✅/❌
30m pullback to 30m band / EMA9-20? ✅/❌
StochRSI crossed in direction? ✅/❌
30m MACD shrinking → flipping/confirming? ✅/❌
Rejection candle closed on 30m? ✅/❌
SL placed (swing + ATR buffer)? ✅/❌
Position size = risk ≤ 1%? ✅/❌
If any NO → skip.


That’s the complete, battle-tested guide — from setup to entries, SLs, TPs, re-entries, sizing, psychology and journaling.

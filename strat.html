✅ Corrected Step-by-Step Strategy

STEP 1 — Mark Previous HTF Candle High + Low

Choose your higher timeframe (4H, Daily, or Weekly).

Mark the previous candle’s high and low.
This gives you the overall zone price is working inside.

✔ This step is correct.

STEP 2 — Identify HTF Mid-Band Direction (Bollinger Middle Band)

Look at the midband direction on your HTF.

If midband is sloping up → bullish bias

If midband is sloping down → bearish bias

✔ Yes, this tells you your trend and directional bias.

❗ STEP 3 (CORRECTED)

Your version is close but slightly off. Here is the correct and consistent version:

ENTRY RULES (LTF Execution Timeframe: 15m / 5m / 1m)

For a BUY example:

A. Stoch RSI must be oversold + crossover upward

This shows momentum on LTF is shifting upward.

B. MACD must support the direction

MACD histogram rising toward 0 OR

MACD signal line crossing upward
(Does NOT need to be fully green yet — lagging indicator.)

C. Price must retrace into the LTF mid-band OR outer band

If you caught the move early → retrace into midband is enough

If you missed the entry → wait for pullback to LTF outer band

D. Then you need a BOS (Break of Structure) in the trend direction

Higher low + break previous minor high = confirmation

E. TP is the HTF midband (trend target)

This keeps the trade aligned with market direction.

✅ So your corrected summary becomes:

✔ STEP 1: Mark previous HTF candle high/low

✔ STEP 2: Check the HTF midband direction (trend)

✔ STEP 3: On the LTF (entry timeframe):

Stoch RSI oversold/overbought + crossover

MACD supporting momentum direction

Price retraces into midband or outer band depending on the setup

PRICE MUST break structure in the direction of the HTF trend

Enter after BOS

TP = HTF midband

SL = LTF outer band (behind pullback)

🧠 Your main confusion — SOLVED

“Price doesn’t always retrace to the outer band, sometimes only to the midband.”

Correct ⬇
✔ If you are entering the FIRST MOVE of the trend:
→ Midband retracement is enough

✔ If you are taking a SECOND-CHANCE entry after missing the first:
→ Wait for outer band retracement on LTF

This is why your strategy now makes sense.

Here’s your idea written out as a clear, step‑by‑step strategy you can test.

I’ll assume **all indicators are on the same (higher) timeframe** you like to trade (e.g., 1H, 4H, daily). If you later want to split into higher/lower timeframes, you can adapt this logic.

---

## 1. Chart setup

On your chosen trading timeframe:

1. Add a **Donchian Channel**  
   - Example: 20‑period Donchian (upper, middle, lower bands).

2. Add these **moving averages** on price:
   - 3‑period MA  
   - 5‑period MA  
   - 9‑period MA  
   - 26‑period MA  
   (Choose EMA or SMA and stick with it; EMA is common.)

3. Add **MACD**:
   - Standard: MACD(12, 26, 9).

## 2. Long trade (buy) rules

### A. Oversold context

1. **Oversold condition (Donchian)**  
   - Price must be at or very near the **lower Donchian band**. You can define this as:
     - Current candle’s low touches or breaks the lower band, **or**
     - Candle closes within a small distance of the lower band (e.g., within 0.1–0.2% or a few ticks).

Only look for longs while this oversold condition has recently occurred (e.g., within the last 3–5 candles).

---

### B. Trigger conditions

2. **Short-term MA crossover (3 & 5)**  
   - The **3‑period MA crosses above the 5‑period MA** (bullish cross).  
   - This should happen **after** or **during** the oversold condition described in step 1.

3. **MACD confirmation**  
   - MACD line **crosses above** the MACD signal line (bullish MACD cross).  
   - This can be:
     - On the same candle as the 3/5 cross, or  
     - Within the last N candles (e.g., last 3–5 candles).  
   - Decide and fix this rule in advance.

4. **Price confirmation over the 9 MA**  
   - After the 3/5 bullish cross, wait for a candle that **closes above the 9‑period MA**.

---

### C. Entry

5. **Enter long**  
   - When all of the following are true:
     - Oversold condition (recent touch/close near lower Donchian band),
     - 3 MA has crossed above 5 MA,
     - MACD has given a recent bullish cross,
     - Current candle **closes above the 9 MA**.
   - Enter at the **close of that candle** (or on the next candle open, depending on how you test/exeute).

---

### D. Stop loss (you need one)

You didn’t specify a stop, but for a workable strategy, choose one and be consistent. Typical options:

6. **Stop loss (pick one rule and keep it fixed):**
   - Option A: A few ticks / pips **below the recent swing low**.  
   - Option B: Just below the **lower Donchian band** minus a small buffer (e.g., 0.5 × ATR).  
   - Option C: Fixed risk like 1× ATR below entry.

Write it as a clear rule, for example:
> “Stop loss goes below the lowest low of the last 10 bars, minus 0.5 × ATR(14).”

---

### E. Take profit

7. **Primary target = 26‑period MA**
   - Your take‑profit is when price **reaches or closes at the 26‑period MA**.
   - You can define:
     - TP triggers when the candle **touches** or **closes above** the 26 MA.

Optional refinement:

- Take partial profit at the 26 MA:
  - Close 50% at the 26 MA.
  - Move stop to breakeven on the rest, and either:
    - Trail with the 9 MA, or  
    - Aim for a second target (previous swing high, upper Donchian band, etc.).

---

## 3. Short trade (sell) – mirrored version

If you want to trade both sides, mirror the rules:

### A. Overbought context

1. **Overbought condition (Donchian)**  
   - Price must be at or near the **upper Donchian band** (touch / break / close near it).

### B. Trigger

2. **Short-term MA crossover (3 & 5)**  
   - 3 MA **crosses below** 5 MA (bearish cross), after/during overbought condition.

3. **MACD confirmation**  
   - MACD line **crosses below** signal line (bearish cross), on or near the same time.

4. **Price confirmation below the 9 MA**  
   - After the 3/5 bearish cross, wait for a candle that **closes below the 9 MA**.

### C. Entry

5. **Enter short**  
   - At the close of the candle that:
     - Occurs after overbought condition,
     - Has 3 < 5 MA,
     - Has recent bearish MACD cross,
     - Closes **below** the 9 MA.

### D. Stop & Target

6. **Stop loss**  
   - Above recent swing high, or  
   - Above upper Donchian band + buffer, or  
   - 1× ATR above entry.

7. **Take profit**  
   - Target when price **reaches or closes at the 26‑period MA** from above.

## 4. How to test and refine

For backtesting (manually or coded):

1. Fix all parameters:
   - Timeframe (e.g., 1H, 4H),
   - Donchian length (e.g., 20),
   - MA type (EMA vs SMA),
   - What “recent” means for MACD and oversold (e.g., last 3–5 bars).

2. Walk through historical charts:
   - Mark each trade that meets all rules.
   - Record entry, stop, target, outcome (R profit/loss).

3. After enough trades:
   - Check win rate,
   - Average R:R,
   - Maximum drawdown,
   - Whether all filters are needed (you might find you can simplify).

If you tell me your exact timeframe and which markets you trade, I can rewrite this in even more concrete terms (e.g., “On 4H BTCUSDT, use Donchian 20, EMA MAs, stop = X, etc.”).

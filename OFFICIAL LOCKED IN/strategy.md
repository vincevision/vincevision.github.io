### **Step 1: The Setup (The Crossover)**

Wait for the **9 EMA** to cross the **21 EMA**.

* **Bullish:** 9 crosses above 21.
* **Bearish:** 9 crosses below 21.
* **Rule:** The candle **must close** to confirm the cross. If the lines are just touching, it is not a trade yet.

### **Step 2: The RSI Filter (The Fuel)**

Look at the RSI (14) immediately after the candle closes.

* **For a Buy:** RSI must be **above 50** (shows momentum is up).
* **For a Sell:** RSI must be **below 50** (shows momentum is down).
* *If RSI is flat at 50, skip the trade; there is no power.*

### **Step 3: The Parabolic SAR (The Trigger & SL)**

Check the dots.

* **For a Buy:** A dot must appear **below** the candle.
* **For a Sell:** A dot must appear **above** the candle.
* **Action:** Place your **Stop Loss (SL)** exactly on that current SAR dot.

### **Step 4: The 5 EMA Exit (The "Scout")**

Add the **5 EMA** to your chart. You use this strictly for managing the exit.

* **How to use it:** Once you are in the trade and the price is moving in your favor, watch the 5 EMA.
* **Exit Signal:** Close the trade if the **price crosses and closes on the opposite side of the 5 EMA**.
* *Example:* If you are in a Buy, and a candle closes **below** the 5 EMA, get out. This gets you out faster than waiting for a 9/21 re-cross.

BUY WHEN 9 and 21 crossover and trail, when 5 crosses over 9 close trade as for sell vice versa
Use overbought over sold indicator for early signals
use macd for added confluence



## **The Setup: Identifying the "Stretch"**

### **1. High Timeframe (HTF) Context**

* **Action:** Mark the High, Low, and Midpoint of the previous HTF candle (e.g., Daily or 4H).
* **Purpose:** These levels act as your primary magnets and psychological barriers.

### **2. Lower Timeframe (LTF) Alignment**

Drop down to your execution timeframe (e.g., 15M or 5M) and observe the **Bollinger Bands**.

* **The Signal:** Look for the price to touch or pierce the **Outer Bollinger Band** while simultaneously hitting the HTF High or Low you marked.
* **The Expectation:** When price hits the outer band and an HTF level, we expect a retrace toward the **Midband** (the 20-period SMA).

## **The Confirmation: Adding Confluence**

To avoid "catching a falling knife," you require two layers of confirmation:

### **3. Overbought/Oversold (OBOS) Check**

* **Condition:** Your indicator (RSI, Stochastic, or Williams %R) must be in the extreme zones.
* **Bullish:** Price at lower outer band + Indicator Oversold (<30).
* **Bearish:** Price at upper outer band + Indicator Overbought (>70).

### **4. The "Trigger" (The Crossover)**

* **Action:** Wait for the **9 MA to cross the 21 MA**.
* **Entry:** Enter the trade only *after* the crossover occurs. This ensures that the momentum has actually shifted in your favor.

## **Trade Management: Risk & Reward**

| Element | Placement Logic |
| --- | --- |
| **Entry** | Immediate market order on the 9/21 MA Cross. |
| **Stop Loss (SL)** | Just outside the **Outer Bollinger Band** (to allow for one last wick). |
| **Take Profit (TP)** | The nearest **Supply/Demand zone** that aligns with the HTF levels on your LTF chart. |

## **Quick Checklist for Your Journal**

* [ ] Is price at an HTF High/Low?
* [ ] Is price touching the LTF Outer Bollinger Band?
* [ ] Is the OBOS indicator showing an extreme?
* [ ] Has the 9 MA crossed the 21 MA?
* [ ] Is the Reward-to-Risk ratio at least 1.5:1?

> **Pro-Tip:** If the Bollinger Bands are "walking the band" (price stays glued to the outer band while it expands), do not enter. Wait for the 9/21 crossover to prove the expansion has ended.

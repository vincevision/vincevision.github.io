### **Step 1: The Setup (The Crossover)**

Wait for the **9 EMA** to cross the **21 EMA**.

* **Bullish:** 9 crosses above 21.
* **Bearish:** 9 crosses below 21.
* **Rule:** The candle **must close** to confirm the cross. If the lines are just touching, it is not a trade yet.

### **Step 2: The RSI Filter (The Fuel)**

Look at the RSI (14) immediately after the candle closes.

* **For a Buy:** RSI must be **above 50** (shows momentum is up).
* **For a Sell:** RSI must be **below 50** (shows momentum is down).
* *If RSI is flat at 50, skip the trade; there is no power.*

### **Step 3: The Parabolic SAR (The Trigger & SL)**

Check the dots.

* **For a Buy:** A dot must appear **below** the candle.
* **For a Sell:** A dot must appear **above** the candle.
* **Action:** Place your **Stop Loss (SL)** exactly on that current SAR dot.

### **Step 4: The 5 EMA Exit (The "Scout")**

Add the **5 EMA** to your chart. You use this strictly for managing the exit.

* **How to use it:** Once you are in the trade and the price is moving in your favor, watch the 5 EMA.
* **Exit Signal:** Close the trade if the **price crosses and closes on the opposite side of the 5 EMA**.
* *Example:* If you are in a Buy, and a candle closes **below** the 5 EMA, get out. This gets you out faster than waiting for a 9/21 re-cross.

### **The "Quick-Look" Checklist**

| Sequence | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| **1. ENTRY** | 9/21 Cross (Confirmed) |
| **2. CONFIRM** | RSI > 50 (Buy) or < 50 (Sell) |
| **3. PROTECT** | Set SL at the Parabolic SAR dot |
| **4. EXIT** | Price closes past the 5 EMA |








###PART 2


Step 1: The HTF Extreme (The Setup)
Go to your Higher Timeframe (H1 or H4).
 * Scan: Wait for price to touch or pierce the Outer Donchian Band.
 * Price Action: Look for a Strong Engulfing Candle rejection. This tells you the "Big Money" has rejected the extreme price level.
Step 2: The LTF Change (Break of Structure - BOS)
Drop to your Lower Timeframe (M5 or M15).
 * The Hunt: Don't enter yet. Wait for price to break the most recent Swing High (for a buy) or Swing Low (for a sell).
 * The Rule: This "Break of Structure" proves that the market is no longer making lower lows (in a buy) and has shifted its character.
Step 3: The Momentum Trigger (9/21 & RSI)
After the BOS occurs, look for your technical alignment:
 * Crossover: The 9 EMA must cross the 21 EMA in the direction of the BOS.
 * RSI Validation: RSI (14) must be above 50 for a buy or below 50 for a sell.
   * Pro Tip: If RSI hasn't crossed 50 yet, wait for it. The RSI is your "engine" confirmation.
Step 4: The Final Entry (Parabolic SAR)
Check your Parabolic SAR dots for the "Go" signal.
 * Trigger: The first dot must appear below the candle (for a buy) or above (for a sell).
 * Action: Open your trade at the close of this candle.
 * Stop Loss (SL): Place your SL exactly at the current Parabolic SAR dot or the wick of the engulfing candle (whichever is safer).
Step 5: The Exit Protocol (The Target)
You now have three specific ways to exit, from safest to most aggressive:
| Exit Signal | Type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| HTF Midband | The Target | Your primary Take Profit (TP). Close 70% of your position here. |
| 5 EMA Close | The Scout | If price closes on the opposite side of the 5 EMA, close the trade. |
| SAR Flip | The Hard Stop | If the Parabolic SAR dots flip to the opposite side, exit everything immediately. |
The Sequence Summary (The "VinceVision" Loop)
 * H1: Hits Outer Donchian + Engulfing? → YES.
 * M15: Price broke the recent swing high/low (BOS)? → YES.
 * M15: 9/21 Cross + RSI > 50? → YES.
 * ENTRY: Buy/Sell on the Parabolic SAR flip.
 * EXIT: Target the H1 Donchian Midline and trail with the 5 EMA.

- Higher TF (HTF) = **Daily (D1)**
- Setup TF (STF) = **H4 or H1**
- Entry TF (ETF) = **M15** (you can refine later to M5 if you want)

You can adjust later, but this is a solid baseline.

---

## 1. Daily (D1) – Big trend + allow/deny direction

Purpose: only decide if you’re allowed to look for BUYS or SELLS on lower TFs.

Use EMAs you already like: **26, 50, 200 EMA** on D1.

**Bullish bias (only look for longs):**

- Price is **above 200 EMA**  
- 26 EMA is above 50 EMA, or both 26 & 50 are above 200 EMA  
- MACD on D1 is **above zero** (or at least not deeply negative)

If those are true:  
→ You are allowed to look for **longs only** on lower TFs.  
→ Ignore any short signals your lower TF might give.

**Bearish bias (only look for shorts):**

- Price is **below 200 EMA**  
- 26 EMA is below 50 EMA, or both 26 & 50 are below 200 EMA  
- MACD on D1 is **below zero**

If those are true:  
→ You are allowed to look for **shorts only** on lower TFs.

If D1 is messy (price chopping around 200 EMA, MACD near zero):  
→ You can choose to **stand aside** or only trade the cleanest pairs.

## 2. H4 (or H1) – Setup zone using Donchian + pullback

Purpose: find **pullback zones** where your lower‑TF entry will make sense.

On H4 (or H1):

- Use the same Donchian you like (e.g. 20‑period).
- Plot 26 EMA as well.

### For longs (D1 bullish bias):

You want **pullbacks in an uptrend**, not chasing highs.

Look for:

1. Price pulling **down toward the H4 lower Donchian band** or at least into the lower part of the recent range.
2. Ideally, price is also near or slightly below the **H4 26 EMA**, not far above it.

Mark this zone mentally (or with alerts):

- “If price is near H4 lower Donchian / 26 EMA in an overall D1 uptrend → I will drop to M15 and watch for my entry rules.”

### For shorts (D1 bearish bias):

Opposite:

1. Price pulling **up toward the H4 upper Donchian band**, or upper part of range.
2. Near or slightly above the **H4 26 EMA**.

That H4 area is your **setup zone**. You don’t execute here; you only get ready.

## 3. M15 – Actual entry with your full strategy

This is where you run your **existing logic**:

Indicators:

- Donchian channel (e.g. 20)
- EMAs: 3, 5, 9, 26
- MACD

### Long entry (only if D1 bias = long, and H4 = in pullback zone):

On M15:

1. **Oversold on Donchian**  
   - Price touches or is very close to the **lower Donchian band**.

2. **3 and 5 cross up**  
   - 3 EMA crosses **above** 5 EMA (bullish cross).

3. **Alignment with 9 EMA**  
   - After the cross, both 3 & 5 EMAs are **above** the 9 EMA.

4. **MACD confirmation**  
   - MACD line crosses **above** signal line (bullish MACD cross).

When all four align on M15 **and** price is in your H4 pullback zone **and** D1 bias is bullish:

→ **Enter long**

- **Stop loss (SL):**  
  - At or just below the **M15 lower Donchian band** (or the H4 lower band if you want a bit more room).
- **Take profit (TP):**  
  - At the **M15 26 EMA** (your original rule),  
  - Or: partial at 26 EMA, and leave a runner with a trail (see below).

### Short entry (only if D1 bias = short, and H4 = in pullback zone):

Mirror it:

1. Overbought on Donchian (touch upper band).  
2. 3 EMA crosses **below** 5 EMA.  
3. Both 3 & 5 are **below** 9 EMA.  
4. MACD line crosses **below** signal line.  

→ **Enter short**, SL at upper band, TP at 26 EMA.

## 4. Optional refinement: trailing and lower‑TF management

Once you’re in a trade from M15, you can:

### A. Manage on M15 itself

- As price moves in your favor and **makes new swings**, trail the SL:
  - For longs: move SL under new **higher lows** or under a rising **M15 lower Donchian**.
  - For shorts: move SL over new **lower highs** or a falling **M15 upper Donchian**.

### B. Or drop to M5 for tighter structure

- Use M5 Donchian:
  - When price surges (e.g. tags M5 upper Donchian in a long), then pulls back but **doesn’t break structure**, trail SL to just below the most recent **M5 swing low** or M5 lower band.
- This gives more active trailing but requires more screen time.

## 5. Daily process (how you actually use this)

Each day / session:

1. **D1 scan (once per day)**  
   - For each of your 5 instruments (gold + 4 pairs), mark:
     - “Only long”, “Only short”, or “Skip” based on 26/50/200 EMA + MACD.

2. **H4 scan (every 4 hours / couple times per day)**  
   - For instruments with a clear D1 bias, wait for price to be in a **pullback zone** (near 26 EMA and Donchian band) in the direction you want.

3. **M15 execution (during your trading session)**  
   - On pairs in pullback zones (step 2), watch M15 and apply your full strategy:
     - Donchian oversold/overbought → 3/5 cross → above/below 9 → MACD cross.
   - Place trade, manage SL/TP & optional trailing.

This way:

- D1 = “Are we buying, selling, or doing nothing?”  
- H4 = “Is price in a good discount/premium zone for that direction?”  
- M15 = “Do I have my precise entry signal yet?”
